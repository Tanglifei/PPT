### Research Background

Cloud computing is a trending topic nowadays, which typically present itself to customer as:
 * Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
 * Platform as a service(PaaS)
 * software as a service(SaaS) 

However, when it comes to industry domain, the story won't end at software but at hardware, which nowadays are typically various Industrial Internet of Things(IIOT) a.k.a. Cyber Physical Systems(CPS)

### Helicopter View Research Questions
Back grounded by Industry 4.0, high-level research question includes: 
 * Methods and Architecture to achieve manufacturing as a service(MaaS) or hardware as a service(HaaS).
 * Infrastructure to manage and monitor these services and data generated from them. 
 * Analyze data generated from them intelligently.

---

### Research Questions Touch Wide Knowledge Domains
* Industry 4.0 in general
* Cloud manufacture modeling and architecture
* Cyber-physical systems e.g. digital twin
* Cloud Infrastructure e.g. existing technical stack
* Big data and Machine learning 
* Communication 
* Security

### T-shaped skills development strategy
The research questions touch wide domains but specific research topic is necessary to accomplish Ph.D study, which is a challenge but perfect chance for T-sharped skills development:  

Horizontal knowledge expansion during first 2-3 years, resulting a gap analyse paper and identification of the specific research angle for vertically diving in for the rest 5 years.

---

### Gap analyse paper 
 * state of art
 * state of practice
 * state of future
 * state of gap

---

### Publication&Study Time Plan
 * Spend first 2-3 out of 8 years on building knowledge and define the specific research angle
 * Aiming at have the gap analyse paper ready at year 2
 * State of art paper as intermediate paper at year 1
 * Plan to and attend courses intensively during first 2-3 years to facilitate build knowledge base
