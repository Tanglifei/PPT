## Research Background

Cloud computing is a trending topic nowadays, which typically present itself to customer as:
 * Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
 * Platform as a service(PaaS)
 * software as a service(SaaS) 

However, when it comes to industry domain, the story won't end at software but at hardware, which nowadays typically are various Industrial Internet of Things(IIOT) aka Cyber Physical Systems(CPS)

## Helicopter View Research Questions
Back grounded by Industry 4.0, high-level research question includes: 
 * Methods and Architecture to achieve manufacturing as a service(MaaS) or hardware as a service(HaaS).
 * Infrastructure to manage and monitor these services and data generated from them. 
 * Analyze data generated from them intelligently.

---

## Research Questions Touch Wide knowledge domains
* Industry 4.0 in general
* Cloud manufacture modeling and architecture
* Cyber-physical systems e.g. digital twin modeling
* Cloud Infrastructure e.g. existing technical stack and use cases 
* Big data and Machine learning

## Narrow Down Research Topic Needed 
Horizontal knowledge expansion during first 2-3 years,resulting a gap analyse paper and identify the specific research angle for vertically diving in for the rest 5 years.
 * state of art
 * state of practice
 * state of future
 * state of gap

---

## Publication&Study Time Plan
 * Spend first 2-3 out of 8 years on building knowledge and define specific research angle
 * Aiming at have the gap analyse paper ready at year 2
 * State of art paper as intermediate paper at year 1
 * Plan to and attend courses intensively during first 2-3 years to facilitate build knowledge base
